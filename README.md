### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Studying computer science at the University of Maryland, I'm an aspiring software engineer 
passionate about turning code into innovative solutions. With a solid foundation in algorithms, 
data structures, and software design, I thrive on hands-on experiences from internships and 
hackathons. The dynamic environment at UMD fuels my curiosity for emerging technologies, 
propelling me towards a future where I contribute to the ever-evolving field of software engineering.
